# PRGGold-webPage

Hello,
welcome to our webpage for Programming Gold assignment. We were originally supposed to be a group of 4, but one 
member didn't show up to any of the lectures and practicals and did not answer to email. So it's just the 3 of us.

We choose Google as our overarching theme and we all made a web page about about one of its aspects (Maps, Translate, and Gmail).
You can navigate between these pages using the navbar at the top.

Hope you like it
Tristan, James, and Sofie
